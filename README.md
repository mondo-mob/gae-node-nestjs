# gae-node-nestjs
## New package
Please note that while this package will have priority fixes for existing projects, our primary focus has moved to
our [gae-js](https://github.com/mondo-mob/gae-js) libraries.

While this library offers a lot of utilities and help for using `nestjs`, `graphql`, `datastore` the new libraries offer 
more targeted libraries, with the following benefits:

 - Not being tied to `nestjs` and easily used in `express`, `cloud functions`, or others of your choosing
 - A library for using `firestore` natively
 - A library for those still using `datastore` mode
 - Other libraries for specifics. Please see the readme for details.

A lot of the underlying utilities have been ported across to the new libraries.
